# Event Services: Categories to Packages Migration

## Overview
The event service admin dashboard has been successfully updated to replace the single `category` field with a `packages` array field. This allows event services to have multiple packages (e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum) instead of just one category.

## Changes Made

### Database Schema Changes
- **Removed**: `category` field (String, nullable)
- **Added**: `packages` field (String array, default empty array)
- **Migration**: Non-destructive migration that preserves existing category data

### Code Changes
1. **Prisma Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
   - Updated `EventService` model to use `packages` instead of `category`

2. **TypeScript Types** (`src/lib/types.ts`)
   - Updated `EventService` interface to use `packages: string[]` instead of `category: string | null`

3. **Form Component** (`src/components/forms/event-service-form.tsx`)
   - Replaced single category input with dynamic package management
   - Added package addition/removal functionality
   - Updated form validation and data handling

4. **Admin Dashboard** (`src/app/admin/event-services/page.tsx`)
   - Updated search functionality to search through packages
   - Updated display to show multiple package badges
   - Updated search placeholder text

## Migration Details
The migration was performed non-destructively:
1. Added new `packages` column with default empty array
2. Migrated existing `category` values to single-element `packages` arrays
3. Removed the old `category` column

**No data was lost** - all existing category values were preserved as the first package in the new packages array.

## How to Use the New Packages Feature

### Adding Packages to Event Services
1. Navigate to Event Services admin page
2. Create a new event service or edit an existing one
3. In the "Packages" section, add one or more packages:
   - Type package name (e.g., "Silver", "Gold", "Platinum")
   - Press Enter or click the "+" button
   - Repeat for additional packages

### Example Package Configurations
Based on the client's business requirements:

**Wedding Service:**
- Silver
- Gold  
- Platinum

**Hosting:**
- Deluxe
- All-in Signature

**Debut:**
- Silver
- Gold
- Platinum

**Birthday:**
- Silver
- Gold
- Platinum

**Hair and Make-up:**
- Classic
- Premium

### Search and Filter
- Search functionality now works across all packages
- Multiple packages are displayed as separate badges
- Each package is color-coded for easy identification

## Benefits
1. **Flexibility**: Services can now offer multiple package tiers
2. **Better Organization**: Clear package differentiation for customers
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add or remove packages as business needs change
4. **Data Preservation**: All existing data was safely migrated

## Technical Notes
- The migration is backward-compatible with existing code
- All existing event services now have their category as their first package
- The UI gracefully handles services with no packages (empty array)
- Search functionality works across all packages for better discoverability
