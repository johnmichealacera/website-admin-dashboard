## üåê Multi-Tenant Deployment

### Prerequisites for Production
1. Set up a PostgreSQL database (e.g., on Neon, Supabase, or Railway)
2. Configure Auth0 application with production URLs
3. Set up Cloudinary account for image storage
4. Configure environment variables for production
5. Run database migrations in production environment

### Environment Variables for Production
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url"

# Auth0
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-production-domain.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-production-client-id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your-production-client-secret
AUTH0_SECRET=your-production-secret
APP_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Cloudinary
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_URL=your-production-cloudinary-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your-production-upload-preset
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-production-api-key
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Auth0 Production Configuration
Update your Auth0 application settings:
- **Allowed Callback URLs**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback`
- **Allowed Logout URLs**: `https://yourdomain.com`
- **Allowed Web Origins**: `https://yourdomain.com`

## üë• User Management

### Access Control Strategies
The system supports multiple approaches for managing multi-tenant access:

1. **Database-Driven Access Control** (Recommended - Current Implementation)
   - Users automatically created on first login
   - Site access managed through UserSite relationship table
   - Admin users can assign/revoke access to specific sites
   - Flexible role-based permissions per site

2. **Auth0 Metadata Access Control**
   - Store allowed site IDs in user's `app_metadata`
   - Manage access rules through Auth0 Actions
   - Check metadata in application for site access

3. **Email Domain-Based Access**
   - Simple approach for organizations with clear email patterns
   - Automatic site assignment based on email domain
   - Implemented through Auth0 Actions

### Setting Up Your First Super Admin
1. Log in to the application once to create your user record
2. Update your user role in the database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE users 
   SET role = 'SUPER_ADMIN' 
   WHERE email = 'your-email@domain.com';
   ```
3. Grant access to all sites:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO user_sites (user_id, site_id, role)
   SELECT 'your-user-id', id, 'ADMIN' FROM sites;
   ```

## üîß Development & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Auth0 callback errors**: Ensure all URLs match exactly in Auth0 settings
- **Environment variables not loading**: Check `.env.local` is in project root
- **Cloudinary upload failures**: Verify API keys and upload preset configuration
- **Database connection issues**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- **Site access problems**: Check UserSite relationships in database

### Development Scripts
```bash
npm run dev                 # Start development server
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run start              # Start production server
npm run lint               # Run ESLint
npm run db:generate        # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:migrate         # Run database migrations
npm run db:seed            # Seed database with sample data
npm run db:studio          # Open Prisma Studio
```
